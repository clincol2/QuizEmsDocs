**Project Title:** QuizEms

**Project Tagline:** The easy solution to practice quizzes and tests!

**Team Members:** Chloe Lincoln, Phillip DaCosta

**Project Description:**
The purpose of our application QuizEms is to provide an easy method of creating practice
quizzes and tests that the professors can share with their students. While most Universities have a
function to create quizzes and tests within their system, the thought behind QuizEms is to eliminate pain
points that stems from that built in function. Some students do not like the thought of the professor
seeing how they did on the practice quiz and test. For professors, they do not like to clutter their quiz
pages to avoid confusion for their students. QuizEms is a website that allows professors to create a
practice quiz, which then can be shared via an invite link. The students then can take the quiz
anonymously and the professor can re-use this practice quiz/test for future classes.
